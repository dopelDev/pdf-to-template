# Executive Summary: PDF Data Extraction Tool

## Purpose
The PDF Data Extraction Tool is designed to automate the extraction of data from images within PDF documents, converting this data into a structured JSON format for easy analysis and display on a web interface. This tool aims to enhance data accessibility and streamline workflows that currently rely on manual data entry.

## Business Justification
- **Efficiency**: Automates the data extraction process, reducing the manpower and time required for data entry tasks.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes human error in data transcription and improves the quality of data captured from PDF documents.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces operational costs by minimizing manual intervention and expediting the data handling process.

## Technical Overview
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Gnu/Linux**: The operating system for hosting the application.
  - **Flask**: Serves the web application.
  - **Poppler**: Extracts images from PDF files.
  - **PDF2Image**: Converts PDF pages to images for further processing.
  - **pytesseract**: Applies OCR technology to extract text from images.
  - **Google Cloud Vision API**: Enhances text recognition capabilities, particularly for formatted data in tables.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **PDF Processing**: The tool processes any PDF file to extract image data.
  2. **Image to Text**: Images are converted to text using advanced OCR technologies.
  3. **Data Structuring**: Extracted text is then structured into JSON format.
  4. **Web Presentation**: Data is displayed on a user-friendly web page accessible internally.

## Strategic Impact
